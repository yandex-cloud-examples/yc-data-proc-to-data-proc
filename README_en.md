# Shared use of tables in Yandex Data Processing through Metastore

You can save data from a [Yandex Data Processing](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc) cluster to a [Yandex Object Storage](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/storage) bucket through a separate Hive Metastore cluster to store table metadata. Thus, you can access the saved data from a different Yandex Data Processing cluster that has access to the bucket and is connected to the same Metastore cluster. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc/tutorials/dataproc-to-dataproc) to learn how to set up the infrastructure for Yandex Data Processing and Object Storage through Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [dataproc-to-dataproc.tf](dataproc-to-dataproc.tf).
